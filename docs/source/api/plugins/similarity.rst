Compute task similarities. Has a bunch of supported similarity measures:

  * FED - Fisher Embedding Distance
  * MMD - Maximum Mean Discrepancy
  * KLD - Kullback Leibler Divergence
  * EMD - Earth Mover's Distance
  * FID - Frechet Inception Distance
  * ENS - Ensemble Distance (combine any other distances to compute this)
